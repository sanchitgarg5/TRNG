True Random Number Generator
====

This is a true random number generator. It generates random numbers using atmospheric noise (which is captured through a microphone) and mouse movement.

To use the application, run FinalMenu.java. You will be presented with 2 options: Create a binary file, generate numbers. First you need to create a file which will consist of binary numbers. Using this file numbers can be generated. Sound is being captured at a default frequency of 16000 Hz. You can increase/decrease this value by editing the sampleRate variable in Sound.java file.
